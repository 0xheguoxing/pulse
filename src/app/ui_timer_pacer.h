// ui_timer_pacer.h - Chooses the main window's kTimerUi period.
//
// kTimerUi polls background results and steps timer-driven animations. At a
// fixed 16 ms it woke the UI thread ~40-60 times a second even when nothing on
// screen could change, which keeps the CPU out of its deep idle states. The
// pacer keeps the fast period while the user interacts or a tick produced
// visible change, and relaxes to a slow poll once the window has been quiet
// for a moment. Any input, paint or dirty tick restores the fast period at
// once, so animations still start on the next display-rate tick; only work
// that begins with no input and no repaint waits for the slow poll. After a
// longer quiet spell the poll slows once more: the producers whose results
// people wait for (folder changes, folder sizes) wake the window themselves
// with WM_UI_KICK, so the slower poll only delays the rest.
