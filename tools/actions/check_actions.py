"""Checks that every action is registered everywhere the assistant needs it.

- src/app/actions/action_inventory.h links each MenuCmd (src/app/context_menu.h)
  and each kCmdGit* (src/app/git_ui.h) to an action, or gives the reason it
  has none. KeyAction coverage is checked at compile time (action_inventory.cpp).
- Every action in the inventory has a registry row (action_registry.cpp
  kDefs), or a reason in kNoRow.
- Every action that takes arguments (kRunners, kExtRunners, the file steps)
  has an argument spec (action_params.cpp kSpecs), and every spec names a
  known action.
- External actions have their own confirm words (kAskIds); only-you actions
  have a lock text (kLockIds); moves and deletes are file steps with a plan
  card (action_files.cpp FileOpOf) or have their own flow (FLOW_MOVES).
- The common actions the run_actions prompt lists exist, and the arguments
  it names are in their specs.

Reports gaps and exits 0; --strict exits 1 when anything is missing.
